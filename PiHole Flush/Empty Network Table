To start with a fresh slate, first flush the actual ARP cache with below one:

sudo ip -s -s neigh flush all

Backup the database in case things go wrong:

cd ~

sqlite3 /etc/pihole/pihole-FTL.db ".backup main pihole-FTL.db.bak"

See whats in it now:

sqlite3 /etc/pihole/pihole-FTL.db "SELECT * FROM network"

Delete them all:

sudo -u pihole sqlite3 /etc/pihole/pihole-FTL.db "DELETE FROM network"

And check again:

sqlite3 /etc/pihole/pihole-FTL.db "SELECT * FROM network"

To rollback and restore the backup:

sudo service pihole-FTL stop

sudo -u pihole sqlite3 /etc/pihole/pihole-FTL.db ".restore main pihole-FTL.db.bak"

sudo service pihole-FTL start

Ps. It might be that you experience a “database is locked” error because pihole-FTL probably locked some temporarily.
Wait a bit and run the query again.

EDIT: removed “VACUUM” from query.
